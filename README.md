## This website generates a random password within the given parameters.

- My motivation for this project was trying to figure out how I could create different passwords with the code I made.
- I built this project to show off my ability to connect Javascript code in order to make an interactive webpage.
- The problem it's supposed to solve is generating a password from the arrays made in the index
